This API is a Swagger API, built on top of LoopBack, with a good portion of the code generated via Loopback-CLI.
This dramatically reduces the amount of work that developers have to do to get the code up and running, and makes the simple job of serving data from an API behind authentication almost trivial.

# Installation

1. Install NPM
2. Install the loopback CLI tool: `npm i -g loopback-cli`
3. Install project dependencies: `npm i`
4. Run the server: `node .`
5. Navigate to `localhost:3000/explore` for an overview of the API, or use the endpoints described there to gather data for your application

# Deployment

This project will be dockerized, eventually. We should also dockerize the database container.
